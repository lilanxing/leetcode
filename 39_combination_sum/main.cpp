/* Given a set of candidate numbers(candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number(target),
 * find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums tp target.
 * The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.
 * Note:
 *     All numbers(including target) will be positive integers.
 *     The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
 * Example 1:
 * Input: candidates = [2, 3, 6, 7], target = 7,
 * A solution set is:
 * [[7], [2, 2, 3]]
